Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing my PhD in Materials Science and Engineering.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to effectively look for jobs...
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on coding projects in materials science.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about how many places I have lived in.
